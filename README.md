Samet | Game Developer

I am a 20-year-old developer with seven years of experience in various tech projects. Over the past five years, I've been active in the gaming industry, focusing on game development using Unity and C#. I've worked in both hypercasual and casual studios, where I refined my skills in creating engaging games.

Beyond game development, I have experience in building robots and machines with Arduino and Raspberry Pi. I also provided 3D printing and robotics coding education at a specialized training institution.

My goal is to excel in the gaming industry by continuously improving my technical and creative skills. I’m driven by a passion for innovation and a commitment to learning, which motivates me to push boundaries and take on new challenges.
